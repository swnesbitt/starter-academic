abstract: The statistical properties of tropic-subtropic precipitation are revealed
  with 13years of Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission (TRMM) precipitation radar (PR)
  measurements. About 3% of PR observations are raining pixels. The average daily
  rainfall over 37.5°N-37.5°S is 1.28, 1.18, and 2.46mmd -1 for convective, stratiform,
  and total rain, respectively, indicating 51.85% from convective rain and 48.09%
  from stratiform rain. The related values are 1.300, 1.272, and 2.573mmd-1 over ocean
  and 1.22, 0.97, and 2.19mmd-1 over land, indicating a convective rain fraction of
  50.51% over ocean and 55.77% over land. The 92% (93%) and 73% (55%) of rain events
  over ocean (land) are from stratiform and convective rain <5mmh -1, respectively,
  while the associated rainfall contributions in stratiform and convective rain are
  62% (68%) and 27% (15%) over ocean (land). Results demonstrate that contributions
  from large rain intensity events are very importation in total precipitation, especially
  over land. The rainfall missed by TRMM PR is mostly light rain and does not significantly
  impact large-scale statistics of convective and stratiform rain amount. Light rain
  will increase the total precipitation by about 10% and, if considered a separate
  category, decrease the observed convective and stratiform rain contributions about
  10% over the PR domain. These statistical properties of precipitation could be utilized
  as a baseline in the assessment of precipitation from operational numerical weather
  prediction and climate models. Key Points Only about 3% of TRMM PR observations
  are raining pixels Ninety-two (93%) of the rain events over ocean (land) are from
  stratiform rain <5 mm hr-1 27% (15%) of convective rainfall over ocean (land) is
  from rain <5 mm hr-1
