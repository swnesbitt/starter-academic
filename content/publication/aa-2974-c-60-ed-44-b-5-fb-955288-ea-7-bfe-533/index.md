abstract: Satellite-based quantitative precipitation estimates (QPE) offer the potential
  for global, near real-time monitoring of precipitation. Provided their accuracy,
  in terms of frequency and intensity structures, can be verified, such products would
  prove to be highly valuable for constraining uncertainty in land data assimilation,
  hydrological simulation and short-term prediction applications. Two gauge-corrected
  and three uncorrected satellite-based QPE products are assessed over México against
  a new composite gauge dataset developed from data collected during the 2004 North
  American Monsoon season. Analysis of daily averaged rain rates, rain-rate conditional
  biases, and frequency maps each show a tendency for uncorrected satellite QPE products
  to overestimate the frequency of moderate to heavy precipitation events (>25 mm/d)
  with respect to gauge-only analyses. While all products reasonably captured the
  large-scale distribution of rainfall, some uncorrected products, particularly those
  emphasizing infra-red based retrieval of rain rates, possessed comparatively low
  pattern correlation scores with the gauge composite. Although gauge-corrected products
  tended to somewhat underestimate rainfall at heavy event thresholds, significant
  value, in terms of overall bias correction, appears to be added to gauge-corrected
  QPE products versus uncorrected products. This added value, however, highlights
  ongoing challenges with regards to collecting and integrating surface gauge data
  in an operational QPE framework.
