abstract: The Canadian CloudSat/Cloud-Aerosol Lidar and Infrared Pathfinder Satellite
  Observations (CALIPSO) Validation Project (C3VP) was a field campaign designed to
  obtain aircraft, surface, and radar observations of clouds and precipitation in
  support of improving the simulation of snowfall and cold season precipitation, their
  microphysical processes represented within forecast models, and radiative properties
  relevant to remotely sensed retrievals. During the campaign, a midlatitude cyclone
  tracked along the U.S.-Canadian border on 22 January 2007, producing an extensive
  area of snowfall. Observations of ice crystals from this event are used to evaluate
  the assumptions and physical relationships for the snow category within the Goddard
  six-class, single-moment microphysics scheme, as implemented within the Weather
  Research and Forecasting (WRF) model. The WRF model forecast generally reproduced
  the precipitation and cloud structures sampled by radars and aircraft, permitting
  a comparison between C3VP observations and model snowfall characteristics. Key snowfall
  assumptions in the Goddard scheme are an exponential size distribution with fixed
  intercept and effective bulk density, and the relationship between crystal diameter
  and terminal velocity. Fixed values for the size distribution intercept and density
  did not represent the vertical variability of naturally occurring populations of
  aggregates, and the current diameter and fall speed relationship underestimated
  terminal velocities for all sizes of crystals.
