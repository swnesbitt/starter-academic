abstract: An event-based method of analyzing the measurements from multiple satellite
  sensors is presented by using observations of the Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission
  (TRMM) precipitation radar (PR), Microwave Imager (TMI), Visible and Infrared Scanner
  (VIRS), and Lightning Imaging System (LIS). First, the observations from PR, VIRS,
  TMI, and LIS are temporally and spatially collocated. Then the cloud and precipitation
  features are defined by grouping contiguous pixels using various criteria, including
  surface rain, cold infrared, or microwave brightness temperature. The characteristics
  of measurements from different sensors inside these features are summarized. Then,
  climatological descriptions of many properties of the identified features are generated.
  This analysis method condenses the original information of pixel-level measurements
  into the properties of events, which can greatly increase the efficiency of searching
  and sorting the observed historical events. Using the TRMM cloud and precipitation
  feature database, the regional variations of rainfall contribution by features with
  different size, intensity, and PR reflectivity vertical structure are shown. Above
  the freezing level, land storms tend to have larger 20-dBZ area and reach higher
  altitude than is the case for oceanic storms, especially those land storms over
  central Africa. Horizontal size and the maximum reflectivity of oceanic storms decrease
  with altitude. For land storms, these intensity measures increase with altitude
  between 2 km and the freezing level and decrease more slowly with altitude above
  the freezing level than for ocean storms.
