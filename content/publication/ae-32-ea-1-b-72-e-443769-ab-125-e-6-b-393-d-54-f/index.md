abstract: Covering December 1997 through December 1998, 261 overpasses of 45 hurricanes
  by the Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission (TRMM) satellite are used to document
  the observed radar reflectivity values, passive microwave ice scattering magnitudes,
  and total lightning (cloud to ground plus in cloud). These parameters are interpreted
  as describing convective vigor or intensity, with greater reflectivities (particularly
  aloft), greater ice scattering (lower 85- and 37-GHz brightness temperatures), and
  increased lightning frequency indicating more intense convection. For each parameter,
  the full distribution of values observed during the TRMM satellite's first year
  is presented for specific regions. Properties of three regions of the hurricane
  (eyewall, inner rainband, and outer rainband) are treated separately and compared
  to other tropical oceanic and tropical continental precipitation systems. Reflectivity
  profiles and ice scattering signatures are found to be fairly similar for both hurricane
  and nonhurricane tropical oceanic precipitation systems, although the hurricane
  inner rainband region yields the weakest of these convective signatures. When normalized
  by the area experiencing significant convection, the outer rainband region produces
  more lightning than the rest of the hurricane or nonhurricane tropical oceanic systems.
  As a whole, the tropical oceanic precipitation systems (both hurricane and nonhurricane)
  are dominated by stratiform rain and relatively weak convection.
