abstract: The Midlatitude Continental Convective Clouds Experiment (MC3E) is a field
  campaign aimed at acquiring a more complete understanding of the physical processes
  driving the life cycle of mid-latitude convective clouds. MC3E took place from 22
  April through 6 June 2011, and was focused at and around the DOE ARM Southern Great
  Plains (SGP) Central Facility (CF) in north-central Oklahoma, where an extensive
  array of both airborne and ground-based instrumentation was deployed. At the top
  of the sampling domain, the NASA ER-2 aircraft functioned as a GPM core-satellite
  sampling simulator. It carried the dual-frequency, dual-beam nadir-pointing Doppler,
  High-Altitude Imaging Wind and Rain Airborne Profiler (HIWRAP), and two multifrequency
  passive microwave radiometers. At the largest scale a radiosonde network was deployed
  to quantify the temperature, humidity, and wind properties of the environment surrounding
  the ARM SGP CF. MC3E staff launched 1,348 coordinated weather balloons from six
  sites at a frequency of four times per day under nonconvective conditions in order
  to partially sample the diurnal cycle. Surrounding the SGP CF was a dense network
  of 18 autonomous Particle Size and Velocity (PARSIVEL) disdrometers. The coordinated
  efforts resulted in a very successful MC3E field campaign whose datasets will be
  the focus of scientific research for many years.
