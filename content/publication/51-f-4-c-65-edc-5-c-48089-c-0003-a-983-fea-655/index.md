abstract: Isolated precipitating convection, though a minor contributor to total rainfall
  in the tropics, is important to regional and seasonal climate variability because
  its diabatic heating structure is characteristic of the convectively inactive phase
  of tropical interseasonal oscillations. This study extends a previous analysis of
  mesoscale convective system (MCS) variability in the South America monsoon system
  to examine regional differences in the annual cycle of the rainfall and vertical
  structure of isolated convection over the 10 year period of 1998-2007. The goal
  is to document the annual variation of shallow and deep isolated convection in order
  to provide a more complete picture of monsoon onset across South America. Over the
  10 year period of 1998-2007, the average rain contribution from isolated convection
  (compared to MCSs) ranged from 1 to 8% of the total rainfall in the four regions
  depending on the season. The contribution of rainfall by isolated convection was
  on the high end of that range during the pre-monsoon months of June to August in
  the tropical regions. Of the isolated convection rainfall, 4-9% was attributable
  to shallow 'warm rain', with the largest fraction after monsoon onset (December
  to February) in the coastal Mouth of Amazon region. Mean annual time series of conditional
  rainfall, lightning activity, 85 GHz ice-scattering signature, and radar echo depth
  for isolated convective features all suggested that an oceanic regime strongly influences
  isolated convection at the Mouth of Amazon region in northeastern Brazil. In the
  interior tropical regions, there was a clear pre-monsoon (August to September) maximum
  in the vertical intensity of deep isolated convection as indicated by lightning,
  ice scattering, and radar echo depth.
