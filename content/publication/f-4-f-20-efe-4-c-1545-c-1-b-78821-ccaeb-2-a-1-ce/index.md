abstract: Cloud evolution during tropical cyclogenesis was examined using the TRMM
  PR products from 3 days before to 1 day after genesis. Precipitation increases substantially
  within 36 h before genesis. Stratiform clouds, mid-level convection, and deep convection
  all contribute to the increasing precipitation. The contribution by stratiform precipitation
  is due to its increasing areal coverage, while its pixel rain rate changes little
  from Day -3 to Day +1. The contribution by mid-level and deep convections results
  from their increasing areal coverage and intensifying rain rates. Among the three
  types of convection, deep convection has the largest pixel rain rate, but mid-level
  convection occurs most frequently and makes the largest contribution to the total
  precipitation. The overall contribution by convective clouds, despite their low
  areal coverage, is comparable to that by stratiform precipitation. It is suggested
  that tropical cyclogenesis may be an outcome of the collective contribution by different
  precipitation types.
