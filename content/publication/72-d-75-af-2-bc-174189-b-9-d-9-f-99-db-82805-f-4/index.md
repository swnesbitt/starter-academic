abstract: The instruments on the Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission (TRMM) satellite
  have been observing storms as well as rainfall since December 1997. This paper shows
  the results of a systematic search through seven full years of the TRMM database
  to find indicators of uncommonly intense storms. These include strong (> 40 dBZ)
  radar echoes extending to great heights, high lightning flash rates, and very low
  brightness temperatures at 37 and 85 GHz. These are used as proxy variables, indicating
  powerful convective updrafts. The main physical principles supporting this assertion
  involve the effects of such updrafts in producing and lofting large ice particles
  high into the storm, where TRMM's radar easily detects them near storm top. TRMM's
  passive microwave radiometer detects the large integrated ice water path as very
  low brightness temperatures, while high lightning flash rates are a physically related
  but instrumentally independent indicator. The geographical locations of these very
  intense convective storms demonstrate strong regional preferences for certain land
  areas while they are extremely rare over tropical oceans. Favored locations include
  the south-central United States, southeast South America, and equatorial Africa.
  Other regions have extreme storms mainly in specific seasons, such as the Sahel,
  the Indian subcontinent, and northern Australia. Because intense storms are distributed
  quite differently from rainfall, these maps provide some new metrics for global
  models, if they are to simulate the type of convection as a component of our climate
  system.
