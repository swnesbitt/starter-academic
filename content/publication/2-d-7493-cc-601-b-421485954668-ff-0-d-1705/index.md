abstract: 'An algorithm has been developed to identify precipitation features (â‰¥75
  km2 in size) in two land and two ocean regions during August, September, and October
  1998. It uses data from two instruments on the Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission
  (TRMM), satellite: near-surface precipitation radar (PR) reflectivities, and TRMM
  Microwave Imager (TMI) 85.5-GHz polarization corrected temperatures (PCTs). These
  features were classified by size and intensity criteria to identify mesoscale convective
  systems (MCSs), precipitation with PCTs below 250 K. and other features without
  PCTs below 250 K. By using this technique, several hypotheses about the convective
  intensity and rainfall distributions of tropical precipitation systems can be evaluated.
  It was shown that features over land were much more intense than similar oceanic
  features as measured by their minimum PCTs, maximum heights of the 30-dBZ contour,
  and 6-km reflectivities. The diurnal cycle of precipitation features showed a strong
  afternoon maximum over land and a rather flat distribution over the ocean, quite
  similar to those found by others using infrared satellite techniques. Precipitation
  features with MCSs over the ocean contained significantly more rain outside the
  250-K PCT isotherm than land systems, and in general, a significant portion (10%-15%)
  of rainfall in the Tropics falls in systems containing no PCTs less than 250 K.
  Volumetric rainfall and lightning characteristics (as observed by the Lightning
  Imaging Sensor aboard TRMM) from the systems were classified by feature intensity:
  similar rain amounts but highly differing lightning flash rates were found among
  the regions. Oceanic storms have a bimodal contribution of rainfall from two types
  of systems: very weak systems with little ice scattering and moderately strong systems
  that do not produce high lightning flash rates. Continental systems that produce
  the bulk of the rainfall (as sampled) are likely to have higher lightning flash
  rates, which are shown to be linked to stronger radar and ice-scattering intensities.'
