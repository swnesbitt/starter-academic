abstract: This study examines the spatial and temporal variability in the diurnal
  cycle of clouds and precipitation tied to topography within the North American Monsoon
  Experiment (NAME) tier-I domain during the 2004 NAME enhanced observing period (EOP,
  July-August), with a focus on the implications for high-resolution precipitation
  estimation within the core of the monsoon. Ground-based precipitation retrievals
  from the NAME Event Rain Gauge Network (NERN) and Colorado State University-National
  Center for Atmospheric Research (CSU-NCAR) version 2 radar composites over the southern
  NAME tier-I domain are compared with satellite rainfall estimates from the NOAA
  Climate Prediction Center Morphing technique (CMORPH) and Precipitation Estimation
  from Remotely Sensed Information Using Artificial Neural Networks (PERSIANN) operational
  and Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission (TRMM) 3B42 research satellite estimates
  along the western slopes of the Sierra Madre Occidental (SMO). The rainfall estimates
  are examined alongside hourly images of high-resolution Geostationary Operational
  Environmental Satellite (GOES) 11-Î¼m brightness temperatures. An abrupt shallow
  to deep convective transition is found over the SMO, with the development of shallow
  convective systems just before noon on average over the SMO high peaks, with deep
  convection not developing until after 1500 local time on the SMO western slopes.
  This transition is shown to be contemporaneous with a relative underestimation (overestimation)
  of precipitation during the period of shallow (deep) convection from both IR and
  microwave precipitation algorithms due to changes in the depth and vigor of shallow
  clouds and mixed-phase cloud depths. This characteristic life cycle in cloud structure
  and microphysics has important implications for ice-scattering microwave and infrared
  precipitation estimates, and thus hydrological applications using high-resolution
  precipitation data, as well as the study of the dynamics of convective systems in
  complex terrain.
