abstract: Recent lake-effect snow field projects in the eastern Great Lakes region
  have revealed the presence of misovortices with diameters between 40 and 4000 m
  along cyclonic horizontal shear zones within long-lake-axis-parallel bands. One
  particular band in which an abundance of misovortices developed occurred on 7 January
  2014. The leading hypothesis for lake-effect misovortexgenesis is the release of
  horizontal shearing instability (HSI). An analysis of three-dimensional dual-Doppler
  wind syntheses reveals that two criteria for HSI are satisfied along the horizontal
  shear zone, strongly suggesting that HSI was the likely cause of the misovortices
  in this case. Furthermore, the general lack of anticyclonic-cyclonic vortex couplets
  throughout the event reveal that tilting of horizontal vorticity into the vertical
  is of less importance compared to the release of HSI and subsequent strengthening
  via vortex stretching. A WRF simulation depicts misovortices along the horizontal
  shear zone within the simulated band. The simulated vortices display remarkable
  similarities to the observed vortices in terms of intensity, depth, spacing, and
  size. The simulated vortices persist over the eastern end of the lake; however,
  once the vortices move inland, they quickly dissipate. HSI criteria are also calculated
  from the WRF simulation and are satisfied along the shear zone. Competing hypotheses
  of misovortexgenesis are presented, with results indicating that the release of
  HSI is the likely mechanism of vortex formation.
