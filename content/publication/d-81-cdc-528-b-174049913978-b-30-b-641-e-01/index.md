abstract: The North American Monsoon Experiment (NAME) is an internationally coordinated
  process study aimed at determining the sources and limits of predictability of warm-season
  precipitation over North America. The scientific objectives of NAME are to promote
  a better understanding and more realistic simulation of warm-season convective processes
  in complex terrain, intraseasonal variability of the monsoon, and the response of
  the warm-season atmospheric circulation and precipitation patterns to slowly varying,
  potentially predictable surface boundary conditions. During the summer of 2004,
  the NAME community implemented an international (United States, Mexico, Central
  America), multiagency (NOAA, NASA, NSF, USDA) field experiment called NAME 2004.
  This article presents early results from the NAME 2004 campaign and describes how
  the NAME modeling community will leverage the NAME 2004 data to accelerate improvements
  in warm-season precipitation forecasts for North America.
