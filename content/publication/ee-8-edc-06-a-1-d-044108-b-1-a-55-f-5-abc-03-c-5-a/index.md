abstract: Differences in the vertical velocity characteristics associated with various
  cloud populations are evaluated for two simulated cases of tropical cyclone (TC)
  rapid intensification (RI) under varying wind shear. Within the radius of maximum
  wind (RMW), preceding RI in the low-shear TC (hurricane Ike of 2008) increased updraught
  magnitudes for the top 1% of the distribution at 7km occur, while in the high-shear
  scenario (hurricane Earl of 2010) RI is led by increased updraught magnitudes of
  the top 1% of the distribution at 12km. Three-dimensional analyses of individual
  updraughts relative to their peak altitude enables direct quantification of processes
  associated with shallow cumuli, cumulus congestus, deep convection failing to penetrate
  the tropopause, and convective bursts (CBs). Mean profiles for each convective regime
  reveal positive contributions in certain variables of each updraught variety towards
  RI with positive diabatic heating, absolute vorticity, and moisture convergence
  roles. Within the RMW, CBs are shown to be the primary diabatic heating and vertical
  mass and vapour flux contributors in both simulations, while Ike includes secondary
  contributions from deep convection and congestus in addition to noteworthy diabatic
  heating from apparent stratiform processes that act to spin up the mid-level vortex.
  Inner-core moisture convergence has divided contributions from shallow cumuli, cumulus
  congestus, and CBs. CBs act to enhance potential vorticity to the greatest amount
  and over the deepest vertical layer at low levels. The simulation results overwhelmingly
  support the aggregate importance of vertically developed deep convection and its
  associated ice processes to the initiation and maintenance of RI.
