abstract: 'The Remote sensing of Electrification, Lightning, And Meso-scale/micro-scale
  Processes with Adaptive Ground Observations (RELAMPAGO) and the Cloud, Aerosol,
  and Complex Terrain Interactions Experiment Proposal (CACTI) field campaigns provided
  an unprecedented thirteen-disdrometer dataset in Central Argentina during the Intensive
  (IOP, 15 November to 15 December 2018) and Extended (EOP, 15 October 2018 to 30
  April 2019) Observational Periods. The drop size distribution (DSD) parameters and
  their variability were analyzed across the region of interest, which was divided
  into three subregions characterized by the differing proximity to the Sierras de
  Córdoba (SDC), in order to assess the impact of complex terrain on the DSD parameters.
  A rigorous quality control of the data was first performed. The frequency distributions
  of DSD-derived parameters were analyzed, including the normalized intercept parameter
  (logNw), the mean volume diameter (D0), the mean mass diameter (Dm), the shape parameter
  (μ), the liquid water content (LWC), and the rain rate (R). The region closest to
  the SDC presented higher values of logNw, lower D0, and higher μ, while the opposite
  occurred in the farthest region, i.e., the concentration of small drops decreased
  while the concentration of bigger drops increased with the distance to the east
  of the SDC. Furthermore, the region closest to the SDC showed a bimodal distribution
  of D0: the lower values of D0 were associated with higher values of logNw and were
  found more frequently during the afternoon, while the higher D0 were associated
  with lower logNw and occurred more frequently during the night. The data were analyzed
  in comparison to the statistical analysis of Dolan et al. 2018 and sorted according
  to the classification proposed in the cited study. The logNw-D0 and LWC-D0 two-dimensional
  distributions allowed further discussion around the applicability of other mid-latitude
  and global precipitation classification schemes (startiform/convection) in the region
  of interest. Finally, three precipitation case studies were analyzed with supporting
  polarimetric radar data in order to relate the DSD characteristics to the precipitation
  type and the microphysical processes involved in each case.'
