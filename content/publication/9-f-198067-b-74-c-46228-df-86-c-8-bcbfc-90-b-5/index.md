abstract: Mass-dimension (m-D) relationships determining bulk microphysical properties
  such as total water content (TWC) and radar reflectivity factor (Z) from particle
  size distributions are used in both numerical models and remote sensing retrievals.
  The a and b coefficients representing m=aDb relationships, however, can vary significantly
  depending on meteorological conditions, particle habits, definition of particle
  maximum dimension, the probes used to obtain the data, techniques used to process
  the cloud probe data, and other unknown reasons. Thus, considering a range of a,b
  coefficients may be more applicable for use in numerical models and remote sensing
  retrievals. Microphysical data collected by two-dimensional optical array probes
  (OAPs) installed on the University of North Dakota Citation aircraft during the
  Mid-latitude Continental Convective Clouds Experiment (MC3E) were used in conjunction
  with TWC data from a Nevzorov probe and ground-based S-band radar data to determine
  a and b using a technique that minimizes the chi-square difference between TWC and
  Z derived from the OAPs and that directly measured by a TWC probe and radar. All
  a and b within a specified tolerance were regarded as equally plausible solutions.
  Of the 16 near-constant temperature flight legs analyzed during the 25 April, 20
  May, and 23 May 2011 events, the derived surfaces of solutions on the first two
  days where the aircraft sampled stratiform cloud had a larger range in a and b for
  lower temperature environments that corresponded to less variability in N(D), TWC,
  and Z for a flight leg. Because different regions of the storm were sampled on 23
  May, differences in the variability of N(D), TWC, and Z influenced the distribution
  of chi-square values in (a,b) phase space and the specified tolerance in a way that
  yielded 6.7 times fewer plausible solutions compared to the flight legs on the other
  dates. These findings show the importance of representing the variability in a,b
  coefficients for numerical modeling and remote sensing studies rather than assuming
  fixed values, as well as the need to further explore how these surfaces depend on
  environmental conditions in ice and mixed phase clouds.
