abstract: This study examines the diurnal cycle of precipitation features in two regions
  of the tropical east Pacific where field campaigns [the East Pacific Investigation
  of Climate Processes in the Coupled Ocean-Atmosphere System (EPIC) and the Tropical
  Eastern Pacific Process Study (TEPPS)] were recently conducted. EPIC (10째N, 95째W)
  was undertaken in September 2001 and TEPPS (8째N, 125째W) was carried out in August
  1997. Both studies employed C-band radar observations on board the NOAA ship Ronald
  H. Brown (RHB) and periodic upper-air sounding launches to observe conditions in
  the surrounding environment. Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission (TRMM) Precipitation
  Radar (PR) and Geostationary Operational Environmental Satellite (GOES) IR data
  are used to place the RHB data in a climatological context and Tropical Atmosphere
  Ocean (TAO) buoy data are used to evaluate changes in boundary layer fluxes in context
  with the observed diurnal cycle of radar observations of precipitation features.
  Precipitation features are defined as contiguous regions of radar echo and are subdivided
  into mesoscale convective system (MCS) and sub-MCS categories. Results show that
  MCSs observed in EPIC and TEPPS have distinct diurnal signatures. Both regions show
  an increase in intensity starting in the afternoon hours, with the timing of maximum
  rain intensity preceding maxima in rain area and accumulation. In the TEPPS region,
  MCS rain rates peak in the evening and rain area and accumulation in the late night-early
  morning hours. In contrast, EPIC MCS rain rates peak in the late night-early morning,
  and rain area and accumulation are at a maximum near local sunrise. The EPIC observations
  are in agreement with previous satellite studies over the Americas, which show a
  phase lag response in the adjacent oceanic regions to afternoon- evening convection
  over the Central American landmass. Sub-MCS features in both regions have a broad
  peak extending through the evening to late night-early morning hours, similar to
  that for MCSs. During sub-MCS-only periods, the rainfall patterns of these features
  are closely linked to diurnal changes in SST and the resulting boundary layer flux
  variability.
