abstract: Strong to violent tornadoes cause a disproportionate amount of damage, in
  part because the width and length of a tornado damage track are correlated to tornado
  intensity (as now estimated through enhanced Fujita scale ratings). The tendency
  expressed in the observational record is that the most intense tornadoes are often
  the widest. Herein the authors explore the simple hypothesis that wide intense tornadoes
  should form more readily out of wide rotating updrafts. This hypothesis is based
  on an application of Kelvin's circulation theorem, which is used to argue that the
  large circulation associated with a wide intense tornado is more plausibly associated
  with a wide mesocyclone. Because a mesocyclone is, strictly speaking, a rotating
  updraft, the mesocyclone width should increase with increasing updraft width. A
  simple mathematical model that is quantified using observations of mesocyclones
  supports this hypothesis, as do idealized numerical simulations of supercellular
  thunderstorms.
