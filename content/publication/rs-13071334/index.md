abstract: Outflow boundaries induced by cold-pools are a key characteristic of convective
  systems related to microphysical and kinematic processes during the mature stage
  of their lifecycle. Over the ocean, such kinematic processes are associated with
  low-level wind modulations that are captured by scatterometers. This study investigates
  the ability of the Advanced Scatterometer (ASCAT) wind retrievals to detect the
  outflow boundary associated with an oceanic mesoscale convective system (MCS). Leveraging
  a new technique to identify cold pools that is based on features that enclose elevated
  magnitude of the gradient of the wind, termed as ‘Gradient Feature’ (GF), wind retrievals
  at 50-, 25- and 7-km spatial resolution were utilized to explore how the characteristics
  of the outflow boundary vary with resolution. Ground-based radar retrievals were
  also implemented to assess and correct, when possible, the performance of the ASCAT
  retrievals. The magnitude of the gradient of the wind for the coarser resolution
  was an order of magnitude smaller (10−4 s−1) than the finer ones (10−3 s−1). An
  increase in the magnitude of the gradient wind field associated with the outflow
  boundary was captured by all resolutions and a respective feature was identified
  by the GF method. The location of the features relative to the distance from the
  front edge of the MCS decreased with resolution, indicating the importance of the
  high resolution ASCAT product to capture their extent, as well as additional smaller
  scale features. The effect of the background wind field on the selection of the
  final wind field during the ambiguity removal process for the high-resolution product
  is also discussed.
