abstract: The Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission (TRMM) satellite measurements from
  the precipitation radar and TRMM microwave imager have been combined to yield a
  comprehensive 3-yr database of precipitation features (PFs) throughout the global
  Tropics (±36° latitude). The PFs retrieved using this algorithm (which number nearly
  six million Tropicswide) have been sorted by size and intensity ranging from small
  shallow features greater than 75 km2 in area to large mesoscale convective systems
  (MCSs) according to their radar and ice scattering characteristics. This study presents
  a comprehensive analysis of the diurnal cycle of the observed precipitation features'
  rainfall amount precipitation feature frequency, rainfall intensity, convective-stratiform
  rainfall portioning, and remotely sensed convective intensity, sampled Tropicswide
  from space. The observations are sorted regionally to examine the stark differences
  in the diurnal cycle of rainfall and convective intensity over land and ocean areas.
  Over the oceans, the diurnal cycle of rainfall has small amplitude, with the maximum
  contribution to rainfall coming from MCSs in the early morning. This increased contribution
  is due to an increased number of MCSs in the nighttime hours, not increasing MCS
  areas or conditional rain rates, in agreement with previous works. Rainfall from
  sub-MCS features over the ocean has little appreciable diurnal cycle of rainfall
  or convective intensity. Land areas have a much larger rainfall cycle than over
  the ocean, with a marked minimum in the midmorning hours and a maximum in the afternoon,
  slowly decreasing through midnight. Non-MCS features have a significant peak in
  afternoon instantaneous conditional rain rates (the mean rain rate in raining pixels),
  and convective intensities, which differs from previous studies using rain rates
  derived from hourly rain gauges. This is attributed to enhancement by afternoon
  heating. MCSs over land have a convective intensity peak in the late afternoon,
  however all land regions have MCS rainfall peaks that occur in the late evening
  through midnight due to their longer life cycle. The diurnal cycle of overland MCS
  rainfall and convective intensity varies significantly among land regions, attributed
  to MCS sensitivity to the varying environmental conditions in which they occur.
