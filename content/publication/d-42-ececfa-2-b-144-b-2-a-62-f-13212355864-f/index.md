abstract: This study investigates (i) the role of orography in precipitation along
  and upstream of the Western Ghats (WG) and (ii) a diurnal cycle of precipitation
  in western India during the summer monsoon, using a high-resolution meteorological
  model and a network of surface rain-gauges over the WG. The Weather Research and
  Forecasting model (WRF-ARW) was used to simulate the 2008, 2009 and 2010 summer
  monsoons at 5 km horizontal grid spacing and allows resolved convection, with initial
  and boundary conditions provided by ERAInterim. The highest daily mean precipitation
  is found immediate to the WG escarpment and coastal plain between 11.5° and 18°N,
  but areas receiving the most rainfall do not necessarily receive it most frequently.
  The greatest percentage of rainy days occurs over the escarpment of the WG and slightly
  inland, corresponding to the topography, and high percentages (over 75%) of rainy
  days occur along the coast, along the coastal plain and the WG. These findings are
  in agreement with several recent studies using high spatial resolution Tropical
  Rainfall Measuring Mission (TRMM) precipitation data. Analysis of WRF output at
  time increments of 30 min reveals a clear diurnal pattern of rainfall, with an early
  morning maximum offshore and afternoon maxima over inland regions that occur later
  in the day with distance inland. A weak land breeze circulation is observed, as
  nocturnal cooling of the land surface results in deceleration of westerly flow upstream
  of the WG. Offshore moisture convergence and destabilization of low-level air results
  in the offshore morning maximum. Rainfall maxima over inland regions indicate that,
  while orography is the primary impetus for lift, rainfall is also convectively driven.
  Analysis of convective parameters and landsurface variables such as soil moisture
  and latent and sensible heat fluxes supports this weak land–sea breeze circulation
  embedded in prevailing westerly monsoonal flow.
