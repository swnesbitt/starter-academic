abstract: "A comprehensive introduction to the current technology and application\
  \ of radar in meteorology and atmospheric sciences. Written by leading experts in\
  \ the field, Radar Meteorology, A first Course offers an introduction to meteorological\
  \ radar systems and applications, with emphasis on observation and interpretation\
  \ of physical processes in clouds and weather systems. This comprehensive introduction\
  \ to the subject offers an overview of the quantities essential to radar meteorology\
  \ including the radar reflectivity factor, and Doppler, dual-polarization, and multi-wavelength\
  \ radar variables. The authors highlight wind retrieval from single and multiple\
  \ Doppler radars, precipitation estimation and hydrometeorological applications,\
  \ with chapters dedicated to interpretation of radar data from warm season mid-latitude\
  \ severe weather, winter storms, tropical cyclones and more. In addition, Radar\
  \ Meteorology highlights research applications of this burgeoning technology, exploring\
  \ dynamic applications such as space-borne and ground-based vertically pointing\
  \ radar systems, and cloud, airborne and mobile radars. As meteorological radars\
  \ are increasingly used professionally for weather observation, forecasting and\
  \ warning, this much-needed text: • Presents an introduction to the technical aspects\
  \ and current application of radar as used in the meteorology and atmospheric sciences.\
  \ • Contains full-colour illustrations that enhance the understanding of the material\
  \ presented. • Examines the wide-range of meteorological applications of radar.\
  \ • Includes problems at the end of each chapter as a helpful review of the contents.\
  \ • Provides full instructor support with all illustrations and answers to problems\
  \ available via the book's instructor website. Radar Meteorology offers a much-needed\
  \ introductory text to the study of radar as applied to meteorology. The text was\
  \ designed for a one semester course based on the authors' own course in Radar Meteorology\
  \ at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign."
