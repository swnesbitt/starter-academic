abstract: Satellite observations have revealed that some of the world's most intense
  deep convective storms occur near the Sierras de Córdoba, Argentina, South America.
  A C-band, dual-polarization Doppler weather radar recently installed in the city
  of Córdoba in 2015 is now providing a high-resolution radar perspective of this
  intense convection. Radar data from two austral spring and summer seasons (2015-17)
  are used to document the convective life cycle, while reanalysis data are utilized
  to construct storm environments across this region. Most of the storms in the region
  are multicellular and initiate most frequently during the early afternoon and late
  evening hours near and just east of the Sierras de Córdoba. Annually, the peak occurrence
  of these storms is during the austral summer months of December, January, and February.
  These Córdoba radar-based statistics are shown to be comparable to statistics derived
  from Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission Precipitation Radar data. While generally
  similar to storm environments in the United States, storm environments in central
  Argentina tend to be characterized by larger CAPE and weaker low-level vertical
  wind shear. One of the more intriguing results is the relatively fast transition
  from first storms to larger mesoscale convective systems, compared with locations
  in the central United States.
