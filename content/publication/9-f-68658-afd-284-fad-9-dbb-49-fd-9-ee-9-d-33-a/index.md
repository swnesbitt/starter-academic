abstract: Atmospheric scientists see a potential in the improvement of climate prediction
  by coupling terrestrial and atmospheric water dynamics. This is also important to
  understand local processes such as evapotranspiration and streamflow. Simplifications
  in numerical models that pertain to terrestrial hydrology must also be addressed
  because such simplifications can limit the numerical prediction capabilities with
  respect to how water partition capabilities with respect to how water partitions
  itself throughout all phases of the cycle. When simplifications have been addressed,
  understanding the feedback interactions between the land surface and the atmosphere
  can be done by defining improved feedback metrics for assessing the relative magnitude
  of soil moisture, vegetation, and snow feedbacks on the atmosphere. There will also
  be a need on models as groundwater flow, unsaturated zone subsurface flow, atmospheric
  flow, vegetation dynamics, and landsurface modules that link below and above-ground
  hydrologic and biogeochemical regimes.
