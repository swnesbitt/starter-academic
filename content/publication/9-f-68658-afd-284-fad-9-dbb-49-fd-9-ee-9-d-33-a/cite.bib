 abstract = {Atmospheric scientists see a potential in the improvement of climate prediction by coupling terrestrial and atmospheric water dynamics. This is also important to understand local processes such as evapotranspiration and streamflow. Simplifications in numerical models that pertain to terrestrial hydrology must also be addressed because such simplifications can limit the numerical prediction capabilities with respect to how water partition capabilities with respect to how water partitions itself throughout all phases of the cycle. When simplifications have been addressed, understanding the feedback interactions between the land surface and the atmosphere can be done by defining improved feedback metrics for assessing the relative magnitude of soil moisture, vegetation, and snow feedbacks on the atmosphere. There will also be a need on models as groundwater flow, unsaturated zone subsurface flow, atmospheric flow, vegetation dynamics, and landsurface modules that link below and above-ground hydrologic and biogeochemical regimes.},
