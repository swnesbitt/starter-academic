abstract: Characteristics of over 15 000 tropical cyclone (TC) inner cores are evaluated
  coincidentally using 37- and 85-GHz passive microwave data to quantify the relative
  prevalence of cold clouds (i.e., deep convection and stratiform clouds) versus predominantly
  warm clouds (i.e., shallow cumuli and cumulus congestus). Results indicate greater
  presence of combined liquid and frozen hydrometeors associated with cold clouds
  within the atmospheric column for TCs undergoing subsequent rapid intensification
  (RI) or intensification. RI episodes compared to the full intensity change distribution
  exhibit approximately an order of magnitude increase for inner-core cold cloud frequency
  relative to warm cloud presence. Incorporation of an objective ring detection algorithm
  shows the robust presence of rings associated with hydrometeors for 85-GHz polarization
  corrected temperatures (P85) and 37-GHz vertically polarized brightness temperatures
  (V37) for differentiating RI with significance levels â‰¥ 99.99%, while 37-GHz false
  color rings of a combined cyan and pink appearance surrounding a region that is
  not cyan or pink lack statistical significance for discriminating RI against lesser
  intensification. Rings of depressed P85 and enhanced V37 tied to RI suggest the
  combined presence of liquid and frozen hydrometeors within the atmospheric column,
  indicative of cold clouds. The V37 rings also exhibit preferences for those with
  collocated more widespread P85 ice scattering signatures to be more commonly associated
  with RI and general intensification.
