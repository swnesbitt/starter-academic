abstract: A multiradar network, operated in the southern Gulf of California (GoC)
  region during the 2004 North American Monsoon Experiment, is used to analyze the
  spatial and temporal variabilities of local precipitation. Based on the initial
  findings of this analysis, it is found that terrain played a key role in this variability,
  as the diurnal cycle was dominated by convective triggering during the afternoon
  over the peaks and foothills of the Sierra Madre Occidental (SMO). Precipitating
  systems grew upscale and mved WNW toward the gulf. Distinct precipitation regimes
  within the monsoon are identified. The first, regime A, corresponded to enhanced
  precipitation over the southern portions of the coast and GoC, typically during
  the overnight and early morning hours. This was due to precipitating systems surviving
  the westward trip (∼7 m s-1; 3-4 m s-1 in excess of steering winds) from the SMO
  after sunset, likely because of enhanced environmental wind shear as diagnosed from
  local soundings. The second, regime B, corresponded to the significant northward/along-coast
  movement of systems (∼10 m s -1; 4-5 m s -1 in excess of steering winds) and often
  overlapped with regime A. The weak propagation is explainable by shallow-weak cold
  pools. Reanalysis data suggest that tropical easterly waves of these regimes, so
  they played a minor role during regimes. Gulf surges occured during a small subset
  of these regimes, so they played a minor role during 2004. Mesoscale convective
  systems and other organized systems were responsible for most of the rainfall in
  this region, particularly during the disturbed regimes.
