abstract: 'Size distributions and other geometric properties of mesoscale convective
  systems (MCSs), identified as clusters of adjacent pixels exceeding a precipitation
  threshold in satellite radar images, are examined with respect to a recently identified
  critical range of water vapor. Satellite microwave estimates of column water vapor
  and precipitation show that the onset of convection and precipitation in the tropics
  can be described as a phase transition, where the rain rate and likelihood of rainfall
  suddenly increase as a function of water vapor. This is confirmed in Tropical Rainfall
  Measuring Mission radar data used here. Percolation theory suggests that cluster
  properties should be highly sensitive to changes in the density of occupied pixels,
  which here translates into a rainfall probability, which in turn sensitively depends
  on the water vapor. To confirm this, clusters are categorized by their prevalent
  water vapor. As expected, mean cluster size and radius of gyration strongly increase
  as the critical water vapor is approached from below. In the critical region one
  finds scale-free size distributions spanning several orders of magnitude. Large
  clusters are typically from the critical region: at low water vapor most clusters
  are small, and supercritical water vapor values are too rare to contribute much.
  The perimeter of the clusters confirms previous observations in satellite, field,
  and model data of robust nontrivial scaling. The well-known area-perimeter scaling
  is fully compatible with the quantitative prediction from the plausible null model
  of gradient percolation, where the accessible hull is a fractal object with dimension
  4/3.'
