abstract: In this study, a 10-yr (1998-2007) climatology of observations from the
  Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission (TRMM) satellite is used to study regional mechanisms
  of monsoon onset across tropical and subtropical South America. The approach is
  to contrast regional differences in the structure, intensity, and rainfall of mesoscale
  convective systems (MCSs) prior to and after onset, in the context of thermodynamic
  conditions from the National Centers for Environmental Prediction (NCEP) reanalysis
  data. This is accomplished by analyzing the mean annual cycle time series, 10-yr
  frequency histograms, and 3-month-averaged values prior to and following onset in
  four regions of distinct rainfall variability. Observed MCS metrics and NCEP variables
  include lightning flash rate, convective rain fraction, height of the 30-dBZ isosurface,
  minimum 85-GHz polarization corrected temperature, and the fluxes of sensible and
  latent heat. The west-central Amazon region had a distinct maximum of MCS intensity
  2 months prior to the monsoon onset date of each region, which was well correlated
  with surface sensible heat flux, despite the observation that thermodynamic instability
  was greatest after onset. At the mouth of the Amazon, the dry season rainfall minimum,
  the premonsoon maximum in MCS intensity metrics, and monsoon onset were all delayed
  by 2-3 months relative to the west-central Amazon. This delay in the annual cycle
  and comparatively large difference in pre- versus postonset MCSs, combined with
  previous work, suggest that the slow migration of the Atlantic Ocean intertropical
  convergence zone controls onset characteristics at the mouth of the Amazon. All
  metrics of convective intensity in the tropical regions decreased significantly
  following onset. These results, in the context of previous studies, are consistent
  with the hypothesis that thermodynamic, land surface, and aerosol controls on MCS
  intensity operate in concert with each other to control the evolution of precipitation
  system structure from the dry season to the wet season. The other two regions [the
  South Atlantic convergence zone (SACZ) and the south], associated with the well-documented
  dipole of intraseasonal rain variability, have a weaker and more variable annual
  cycle of all MCS metrics. This is likely related to the strong influence of baroclinic
  circulations and frontal systems in those regions. In the south, fewer but larger
  and more electrified MCSs prior to onset transition to more, smaller, and less electrified
  MCSs after onset, consistent with previous climatologies of strong springtime mesoscale
  convective complexes in that region.
