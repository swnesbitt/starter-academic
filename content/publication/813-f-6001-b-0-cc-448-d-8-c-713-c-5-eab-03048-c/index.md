abstract: Land use change for bioenergy feedstocks is likely to intensify as energy
  demand rises simultaneously with increased pressure to minimize greenhouse gas emissions.
  Initial assessments of the impact of adopting bioenergy crops as a significant energy
  source have largely focused on the potential for bioenergy agroecosystems to provide
  global-scale climate regulating ecosystem services via biogeochemical processes.
  Such as those processes associated with carbon uptake, conversion, and storage that
  have the potential to reduce global greenhouse gas emissions (GHG). However, the
  expansion of bioenergy crops can also lead to direct biophysical impacts on climate
  through water regulating services. Perturbations of processes influencing terrestrial
  energy fluxes can result in impacts on climate and water across a spectrum of spatial
  and temporal scales. Here, we review the current state of knowledge about biophysical
  feedbacks between vegetation, water, and climate that would be affected by bioenergy-related
  land use change. The physical mechanisms involved in biophysical feedbacks are detailed,
  and interactions at leaf, field, regional, and global spatial scales are described.
  Locally, impacts on climate of biophysical changes associated with land use change
  for bioenergy crops can meet or exceed the biogeochemical changes in climate associated
  with rising GHG's, but these impacts have received far less attention. Realization
  of the importance of ecosystems in providing services that extend beyond biogeochemical
  GHG regulation and harvestable yields has led to significant debate regarding the
  viability of various feedstocks in many locations. The lack of data, and in some
  cases gaps in knowledge associated with biophysical and biochemical influences on
  land-atmosphere interactions, can lead to premature policy decisions.
