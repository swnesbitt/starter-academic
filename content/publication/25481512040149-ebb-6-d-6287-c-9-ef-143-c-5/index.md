abstract: The Optical Transient Detector (OTD) lightning data for the 12-month period
  of 1996 are used to estimate the seasonal and global distributions of lightning-produced
  NO(x). The relatively small viewing footprint and the low detection of the OTD sensor
  and other difficulties require extrapolations of the OTD data to the actual global
  flash distributions. Furthermore, available measurements for the ratios of intracloud
  (IC) to cloud-to-ground (CG) flashes have been used to partition lightning counts
  for IC versus CG flashes from the OTD observations. The resulting lightning distributions
  are then used to calculate the global and seasonal production of NO(x), assuming
  a NO production rate of 6.2 x 1025 molecules for each CG flash and 8.7 x 1024 molecules
  for each IC flash. Consequently, we find that CG flashes produce more NO(x) than
  IC flashes despite fewer CG flashes by a factor of 3 or more. NO(x) production by
  lightning varies seasonally in accordance with the global lightning distribution,
  with the maximum production occurring in the Northern Hemisphere in the local summer.
  The latitudinal distribution of NO(x) production exhibits a strong seasonal variation
  outside the tropics with the production occurring mainly in the summer hemisphere,
  whereas in the tropics the production is high throughout the year. The annual contribution
  to NO(x) production by lightning is higher in the Northern Hemisphere than that
  in the Southern Hemisphere.
