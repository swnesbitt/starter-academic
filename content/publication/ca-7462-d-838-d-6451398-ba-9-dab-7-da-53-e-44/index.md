abstract: Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission (TRMM) Precipitation Radar (PR), TRMM
  Microwave Imager (TMI), and Visible and Infrared Scanner (VIRS) observations within
  the Precipitation Feature (PF) database have been analyzed to examine regional variability
  in rain area and maximum horizontal extent of rainfall features, and role of storm
  morphology on rainfall production (and thus modes where vertically integrated heating
  occurs). Particular attention is focused on the sampling geometry of the PR and
  the resulting impact on PF statistics across the global Tropics. It was found that
  9% of rain features extend to the edge of the PR swath, with edge features contributing
  42% of total rainfall. However, the area (maximum dimension) distribution of PR
  features is similar to the wider-swath TMI up until a truncation point of nearly
  30 000 km2 (250 km), so a large portion of the feature size spectrum may be examined
  using the PR as with past ground-based studies. This study finds distinct differences
  in land and ocean storm morphology characteristics, which lead to important differences
  in rainfall modes regionally. A larger fraction of rainfall comes from more horizontally
  and vertically developed PFs over land than ocean due to the lack of shallow precipitation
  in both relative and absolute frequency of occurrence, with a trimodal distribution
  of rainfall contribution versus feature height observed over the ocean. Mesoscale
  convective systems (MCSs) are found to be responsible for up to 90% of rainfall
  in selected land regions. Tropicswide, MCSs are responsible for more than 50% of
  rainfall in almost all regions with average annual rainfall exceeding 3 mm day-1.
  Characteristic variability in the contribution of rainfall by feature type is shown
  over land and ocean, which suggests new approaches for improved convective parameterizations.
