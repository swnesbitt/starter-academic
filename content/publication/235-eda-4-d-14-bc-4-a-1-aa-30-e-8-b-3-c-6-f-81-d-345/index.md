abstract: Mass-dimension (m-D) relationships determining bulk microphysical properties
  such as total water content (TWC) and radar reflectivity factor (Z) from particle
  size distributions are used in both numerical models and remote sensing retrievals.
  The a and b coefficients representing m=aD b relationships, however, can vary significantly
  depending on meteorological conditions, particle habits, the definition of particle
  maximum dimension, the probes used to obtain the data, techniques used to process
  the cloud probe data, and other unknown reasons. Thus, considering a range of a,b
  coefficients may be more applicable for use in numerical models and remote sensing
  retrievals. Microphysical data collected by two-dimensional optical array probes
  (OAPs) installed on the University of North Dakota (UND) Citation aircraft during
  the Mid-latitude Continental Convective Clouds Experiment (MC3E) were used in conjunction
  with TWC data from a Nevzorov probe and ground-based S-band radar data to determine
  a and b using a technique that minimizes the chi-square difference between the TWC
  and Z derived from the OAPs and those directly measured by a TWC probe and radar.
  All a and b values within a specified tolerance were regarded as equally plausible
  solutions. Of the 16 near-constant-temperature flight legs analyzed during the 25
  April, 20 May, and 23 May 2011 events, the derived surfaces of solutions on the
  first 2 days where the aircraft-sampled stratiform cloud had a larger range in a
  and b for lower temperature environments that correspond to less variability in
  N(D), TWC, and Z for a flight leg. Because different regions of the storm were sampled
  on 23 May, differences in the variability in N(D), TWC, and Z influenced the distribution
  of chi-square values in the (a,b) phase space and the specified tolerance in a way
  that yielded 2.8 times fewer plausible solutions compared to the flight legs on
  the other dates. These findings show the importance of representing the variability
  in a,b coefficients for numerical modeling and remote sensing studies, rather than
  assuming fixed values, as well as the need to further explore how these surfaces
  depend on environmental conditions in clouds containing ice hydrometeors.
