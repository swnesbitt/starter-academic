abstract: This study uses an improved surge identification method to examine composites
  of 29 yr of surface observations and reanalysis data alongside 10 yr of satellite
  precipitation data to reveal connections between flow, thermodynamic parameters,
  and precipitation, both within and outside of the North American monsoon (NAM) region,
  associated with Gulf of California (GoC) moisture surges. The North American Regional
  Reanalysis (NARR), examined using composites of flow during all detected moisture
  surges at Yuma, Arizona, and so-called wet and dry surges (those producing anomalously
  high and low precipitation, respectively, over Arizona and New Mexico), show markedly
  different flow and moisture patterns that ultimately lead to the differing observed
  precipitation distributions in the region. Wet surges tend to be associated with
  moister precursor air masses over the southwestern United States, have a larger
  contribution of enhanced easterly cross-Sierra Madre Occidental (SMO) moisture transport,
  and tend to result from a transient cyclonic disturbance tracking across northern
  Mexico. Dry surges tend to be associated with a more southerly tracking disturbance,
  are associated with less convection over the SMO, and tend to be associated with
  a drier presurge air mass over Arizona and New Mexico.
