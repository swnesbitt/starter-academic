abstract: The bulk radar reflectivity structures, 85- and 37-GHz brightness temperatures,
  and lightning charateristics of precipitating systems in tropical Africa, South
  America, the east Pacific, and west Pacific are documented using data from the Tropical
  Rainfall Measuring Mission (TRMM) satellite during August, September, and October
  of 1998. The particular focus is on precipitation features [defined as a contiguous
  area ≥75 km2 with either a near-surface reflectivity ≥20 dBZ or an 85-GHz polarization-corrected
  temperature (PCT) ≤ 250 K] with appreciable rainfall, which account for the bulk
  of the total rainfall and lightning flash density in their respective regions. Systems
  over the tropical continents typically have greater magnitudes of reflectivity extending
  to higher altitudes than tropical oceanic systems. This is consistent with the observation
  of stronger ice scattering signatures (lower 85- and 37-GHz PCT) in the systems
  over land. However, when normalized by reflectivity heights, tropical continental
  features consistently have higher 85-GHz PCT than tropical oceanic features. It
  is inferred that greater supercooled water contents aloft in the tropical continental
  systems contribute to this brightness temperature difference. Lightning (as detected
  by the Lightning Imaging Sensor) is much more likely in tropical continental features
  than tropical oceanic features with similar brightness temperatures or similar reflectivity
  heights. Vertical profiles of radar reflectivity add additional information to the
  nonunique lightning-brightness temperature relationships showing that features with
  lightning tend to have greater magnitudes of reflectivity and smaller decreases
  of reflectivity with height above the freezing level than systems without detected
  lightning. Regional comparisons of the lightning, radar, and microwave signatures
  of precipitating features show that, over the oceans, the west Pacific has the highest
  frequency of intense precipitation features (by minimum PCT or maximum reflectivity
  height). Over land, the intense precipitation features occur more frequently in
  Africa. These observations are consistent with the relative differences in lightning
  flash density between the land and ocean regions. The quantitative database of land
  and ocean features presented here provides a substantial observational framework
  against which cloud and radiative transfer model results can be tested.
