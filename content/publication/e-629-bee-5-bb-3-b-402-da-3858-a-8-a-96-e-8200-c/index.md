abstract: 'A Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission (TRMM) climatology shows variability
  in surface precipitation rate-elevation relationships across the tropics. Vertical
  profiles of radar reflectivity and profiles of specific humidity and cross-barrier
  moisture fluxes during precipitation events from the Interim European Centre for
  Medium-Range Weather Forecasts Re-Analysis reveal four precipitation regimes with
  distinct precipitation mechanisms: 1) a tropical regime with a broad precipitation
  maximum at âˆ¼ 1500m where convection is triggered by orographic lifting; 2) a trade
  winds regime with a near-sea level precipitation maximum dominated by forced ascent
  due to prevailing winds and the presence of dry air aloft; 3) a wet monsoon regime
  with a low-elevation precipitation maximum driven by efficient precipitation generation,
  large low-level crossbarrier moisture fluxes, and multiple convective modes; and
  4) a dry monsoon regime with a high-elevation precipitation maximum reflecting intense
  convection and stratiform rain with a strong evaporation signature. In general,
  surface precipitation-elevation relationships across the tropics feature lower-elevation
  precipitation maxima relative to typical midlatitude regimes.'
