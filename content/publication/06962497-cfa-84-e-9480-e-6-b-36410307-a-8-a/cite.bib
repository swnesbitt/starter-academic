 abstract = {The measurements of nearly 6 million precipitation features observed during the Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission's (TRMM's) first three years were examined. Most produced no lightning during the 80 s of observation by TRMM, but the most vigorous produced hundreds of flashes per minute. Storms were sorted by size, flash rate, rainfall, radar reflectivity, and microwave brightness temperature, with emphasis on the rarest events. It was found that there is considerable overlap between the greatest storms.},
