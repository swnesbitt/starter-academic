abstract: The measurements of nearly 6 million precipitation features observed during
  the Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission's (TRMM's) first three years were examined.
  Most produced no lightning during the 80 s of observation by TRMM, but the most
  vigorous produced hundreds of flashes per minute. Storms were sorted by size, flash
  rate, rainfall, radar reflectivity, and microwave brightness temperature, with emphasis
  on the rarest events. It was found that there is considerable overlap between the
  greatest storms.
