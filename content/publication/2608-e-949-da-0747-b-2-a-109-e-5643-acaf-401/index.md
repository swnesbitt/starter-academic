abstract: Scattering models of precipitation-size ice particles have shown that aggregates
  and spheroidal particles occupy distinct regions of the Ku-Ka-W-band dual-frequency
  ratio (DFR) plane. Furthermore, past ground-based observations suggest that particle
  bulk density and characteristic size can be retrieved from the DFR plane. This study,
  for the first time, evaluates airborne DFR observations with coincident airborne
  microphysical measurements. Over 2Â hr of microphysical data collected aboard the
  University of North Dakota Citation from the Olympic Mountains Experiment are matched
  with Airborne Precipitation and cloud Radar Third Generation triple-frequency radar
  observations. Across all flights, 31% (63%) of collocated data points show nonspheroidal
  (spheroidal) particle scattering characteristics. DFR observations compared with
  in situ observations of effective density and particle characteristic size reveal
  relationships that could potentially be used to develop quantitative dual- and triple-frequency
  DFR ice property retrievals.
