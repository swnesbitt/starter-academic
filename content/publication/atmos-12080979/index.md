abstract: 'This study compared drop size distribution (DSD) measurements on the surface,
  the corresponding properties, and the precipitation modes among three deep convective
  regions within the Americas. The measurement compilation corresponded to two sites
  in the midlatitudes: the U.S. Southern Great Plains and Córdoba Province in subtropical
  South America, as well as to one site in the tropics: Manacapuru in central Amazonia;
  these are all areas where intense rain-producing systems contribute to the majority
  of rainfall in the Americas’ largest river basins. This compilation included two
  types of disdrometers (Parsivel and 2D-Video Disdrometer) that were used at the
  midlatitude sites and one type of disdrometer (Parsivel) that was deployed at the
  tropical site. The distributions of physical parameters (such as rain rate R, mass-weighted
  mean diameter Dm, and normalized droplet concentration Nw) for the raindrop spectra
  without rainfall mode classification seemed similar, except for the much broader
  Nw distributions in Córdoba. The raindrop spectra were then classified into a light
  precipitation mode and a precipitation mode by using a cutoff at 0.5 mm h−1 based
  on previous studies that characterized the full drop size spectra. These segregated
  rain modes are potentially unique relative to previously studied terrain-influenced
  sites. In the light precipitation and precipitation modes, the dominant higher frequency
  observed in a broad distribution of Nw in both types of disdrometers and the identification
  of shallow light precipitation in vertically pointing cloud radar data represent
  unique characteristics of the Córdoba site relative to the others. As a result,
  the co-variability between the physical parameters of the DSD indicates that the
  precipitation observed in Córdoba may confound existing methods of determining the
  rain type by using the drop size distribution.'
